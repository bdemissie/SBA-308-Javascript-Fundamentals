// You will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application. The data you will use is provided below.
// You will be provided with four different types of data:
// A CourseInfo object, which looks like this:
// {
//   "id": number,
//   "name": string,
// }

// An AssignmentGroup object, which looks like this:
// {
//   "id": number,
//   "name": string,
//   // the ID of the course the assignment group belongs to
//   "course_id": number,
//   // the percentage weight of the entire assignment group
//   "group_weight": number,
//   "assignments": [AssignmentInfo],
// }

// Each AssignmentInfo object within the assignments array looks like this:
// {
//   "id": number,
//   "name": string,
//   // the due date for the assignment
//   "due_at": Date string,
//   // the maximum points possible for the assignment
//   "points_possible": number,
// }

// An array of LearnerSubmission objects, which each look like this:
// {
//     "learner_id": number,
//     "assignment_id": number,
//     "submission": {
//       "submitted_at": Date string,
//       "score": number
//     }
// }

// Your goal is to analyze and transform this data such that the output of your program is an array of objects, each containing the following information in the following format:
// {
//     // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
//     "id": number,
//     // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
//     // with more points_possible should be counted for more
//     // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
//     // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
//     "avg": number,
//     // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
//     // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
//     // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
//     <assignment_id>: number,
//     // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
//     // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
// }

// The provided assignment group.
